# Formality

A upcoming efficient proof-gramming language. It aims to be:

- **Fast:** no garbage-collection, optimal beta-reduction and a massively parallel GPU compiler make it fast.

- **Safe:** a type system capable of proving mathematical theorems about its own programs make it secure.

- **Portable:** the full language is implemented in a 400-LOC runtime, making it easily available everywhere.

Formality isn't ready yet, but you can already use [Formality-Core](/docs/FM-Core.md), our low-level compile target ([check its docs!](https://docs.formality-lang.org/en/latest/)), and [EA-TT](/docs/EA-TT.md), our underlying proof language.

## Projects

For a better separation of concerns, Formality was broken down into sub-projects:

Features | **Calculus** | **Type-Theory** | **Runtime**
--- | --- | --- | ---
Lam, Box | [EA-Core](/docs/EA-Core.md) | [EA-TT](/docs/EA-TT.md) | [EA-Net](/docs/EA-Net.md)
Lam, Box, Pair, Uint32 | [FM-Core](/docs/FM-Core.md) | [FM-TT - TODO](/docs/FM-TT.md) | [FM-Net](/docs/FM-Net.md)

`FM-Core` is our low-level, untyped compile target, `FM-TT` is our raw type theory and `FM-Net` is our efficient interaction-net runtime. `EA-Core`, `EA-TT` and `EA-Net` are their formalization-friendly counterparts, excluding native ints to be easier to reason about. Formality will be a high-level, Python/Agda-inspired syntax built on top of those. [Here is a sneak peek!](https://gist.github.com/MaiaVictor/489a4119efd49f16605f8d4d09d421ad)

### Progress Table

Note: most reference implementations were written in **JavaScript** simply because it is a cross-platform language, but we plan to re-implement all those things inside **Formality-Core**. Once this is done, we will port them Haskell, Rust, Python etc. by a simple bootstrapping process: 1. implement just the runtime ([FM-Net, a 400-LOC file](https://gitlab.com/moonad/Formality-JavaScript/blob/master/FM-Net/fm-net.js)), 2. load the desired lib on it.
